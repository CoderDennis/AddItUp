# AddItUp!

Simple app for generating addition math problems.

My 9-year-old daughter kept asking me for numbers, so I asked her if she wanted an app to do that. She drew up the UI and I built it using Elm.

Also using this to experiment with Progressive Web Apps, but it doesn't yet meet the requirements for that.
